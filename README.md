# BAC Caclulator
  ### By Mitch Edison & Drew Mares
--------
An app made for a class project at Augsburg University. This app is a simple streamlined BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) calculator meant to be more user friendly than other apps currently on the app store. Although not a perfectly accurate representation of a user's BAC, the goal is to make a user more aware of their BAC levels. The app will contain information about BAC, how body types and age affect it, and possibly the consquences of driving with a BAC above the limit. <br>
Our goal is to use algorithms to calculate the users BAC based off of their physical info entered into the app as well as the food they have eaten. Of course the most important part is the drinks the user has had and the time for each drink. We are trying to make the majority of the information optional so as to minimize the amount of info the user needs to enter. If they want a more detailed number then they can choose to enter in more information. A simple layout combined with a minimal number of taps will hopefully set our app apart from others, which require large amounts of typing hampered by clunky interfaces.<br>

## Planned Features <br>

2) ~~Save user profile, to reduce info entered each time~~ 
4) Allow multiple user profiles (Not possible without external database)
5) Store past drinks for easy entering of repeat drinks
6) ~~Allow user to favorite drinks~~
7) Easy "Reuse last drink" button to simplify entering
8) Allow changing quantity to enter drinks in bulk
9) Allow user to sync to contacts to quick send text or location 
10) Prompt user to request a ride sharing service if BAC is above legal limit 

## Why we wanted to make this App <br>
Being college students turning, or recently turned, 21, alcohol is something that is a part of our social lives. Well we wanted a way to be able to drink, but do so in a smart fashion when possible. We figured it would be nice to know our Blood Acohol Content (BAC) while we were drinking. We scoured the app store and found a few apps that tracked your drink and used various algorithms to determine your BAC. The problem was every app was clunky, took too many steps to enter a drink, or overall just was not good to look at. This made entering drinks or information so much of a hassle that we just didn't do it. When we had to pick an app for a class project, we knew what we wanted to do.

We figured we could make our own app that is more user friendly and much more streamlined. Be able to enter drinks in as few taps as possible, avoid typing at all costs, and keep it simple enough that even someone who was intoxicated could do it. Being more user friendly is the most important part. A simple design that is easy to understand will go a long way. Colors and images are something that can always be updated, and are very important, but the usability is the focus. 

This will be the first app we produce and publish on the app store so there will be hurdles along the way. Our final product may not be exactly what we dreamed of, but it will be a work in progress for a longtime as this is something that is usable to us. We want to constantly improve and fix bugs because this is an app that we ourselves will be using as well.
